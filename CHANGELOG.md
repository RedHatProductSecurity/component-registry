This page provides a changelog for Red Hat's Component Registry. This mostly covers issues tracked in the
[CORGI Jira project](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=CORGI&rapidView=15542).

## Date of next release

Add new changes to a subsection in this section.
During a release, add a new top-level section below (with two hashtags),
then set its date to match the release date.

### Subsection name
